'''You are given an array A of N integers and an integer B. Count the number of pairs (i,j) such that A[i] + A[j] = B and i â‰  j.

Since the answer can be very large, return the remainder after dividing the count with 109+7.

Note - The pair (i,j) is same as the pair (j,i) and we need to count it only once.'''
